## Conclusions and Links to the datasets used
### Dastan Abdulla's Conclusion
Public Safety:</br>
After a thorough analysis of the given data, we can conclude that the safest neighborhood is Fairywood. However, the rest of the neighborhoods are incredibly close, except for West End, South Shore, and Chateau. The methodology used in the analysis considers various factors such as murder, rape, robbery, drug use, assaults, and auto theft. I divided the total of the crimes by the neighborhood population to calculate a relative percentage of overall crime.
### Anna Speciale's Conclusion 
Education-Income:</br>
For the sake of simplicity in the end I decide to focus on the percentage of the populations that attained postgraduate degrees. By this logic the highest percentage of people with a postgraduate degree, the highest form of education in this data set, would be considered the "best" neighborhood. The data set shows that South Shore has the highest percentage at 47.6% or .476. I am not from Pittsburgh so I don't think I have a personal favorite neighborhood. I can't really speak on whether or not these data sets align properly with how good the neighborhoods are since I haven't spent time in most of them.
### Lucas Milavec's Conclusion
Land use zoning:</br>

## Final Conclusion:
Overall, the best neighborhood, the relative intersection between the three data sets, is Regent Square. Regent Square has an education attainment rate of 44%, which is the second-highest in Anna's dataset. It also has a 1.18% crime rate according to the metric used in Dastan Abdulla's data set. While Regent Square doesn't have the lowest crime rate, many neighborhoods have a small margin of less than 2% crime rate in the public safety dataset, which renders the margin irrelevant in the overall scope.
